# 🌊 Ocean Noise Pollution Analyzer

## 📌 Overview

The **Ocean Noise Pollution Analyzer** is a Machine Learning-based project designed to analyze and classify underwater acoustic signals. The system identifies different types of ocean noise (such as anthropogenic and natural sounds) using structured sonar/acoustic data and evaluates model performance through multiple metrics.
